# Fantasy NBA 2021
 
Here you have a little bit of code that I used to analyse some data for a Fantasy NBA that I do with my friends.

The code in the file Get_Data_Get_useful_Graphics_Today is a RMarkdawn script that will search for all the Data of the matches this season, the data of the players on ESPN that you can get the today and will do a graphic about the evollution of the most interesting players you can get.
It also checks what days do you have downloaded to save time and space every time you execute the code.

The other files are used to get data only of one specific day or to get only the graphics, and to do some tests in general.

Note that it can be improoved and that you may have to do some changes to work in your machine, like change the directory from wher R reads the files or login previously on the ESPN page.

This was a project for fun, but if someone is interested send me a message and i will be very pleased to help!
